# Lesson 02 - Setting up with Create React App

- `create-react-app` is cli for production-grade level development
    - Recommended approach over CDN
    - CDN is too large to serve in production (~1MB)
- to start, the instruction can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

    Example
    ```
    npx create-react-app my-app
    cd my-app
    npm start
    ```

    - make sure to have npm >= 5.6 and node >= 8.10 installed
